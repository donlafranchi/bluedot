## **Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)**

Most people feel the impact of political and corporate decisions — higher prices, worse jobs, environmental risks — but they rarely understand *why* things happen or *what they can do* about it. One Dot fixes that.

Open the app and you see a few key stories of the week. You tap how you feel — confused, concerned, angry — and the app explains the issue in 40 words or less, with a simple visual showing how it affects quality of life for workers, households, corporations, or the environment. Then, in one tap, you can call or message your representative with a pre-drafted script.

No doomscrolling. No partisanship.
Just **story → feeling → clarity → visual → action**, all in under a minute.

One Dot is the first action-first civic app that turns news into instant civic power.

They need a bridge.
